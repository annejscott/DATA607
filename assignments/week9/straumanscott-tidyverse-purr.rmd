This paper will use a sample dataset from Kaggle.com to 
create a programming sample “vignette” that demonstrates how to use the  map functions of the `purrr` TidyVerse package [@purrr].

The 'purrr' package loads automatically as part of the `tidyverse` series of R packages.

```{r load-libraries, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

We load a dataset from Kaggle.com with data from All data is from American Community Survey 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series [@kaggle].

```{r}
majors <- read_csv('https://github.com/annejscott/DATA607/raw/main/assignments/week9/all-ages.csv', col_names = TRUE, show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  as.data.frame()
```

To create a new column with the percent of graduates from each major who are employed full time, we define a function to calculate the percentage employed, and then use the `purrr` package to `map` that function onto our data (in this case, `purrr::map2_dbl()` specifically.

```{r function-def}
calculate_proportion_employed <- function(full_time_employed, total) {
  proportion <- full_time_employed / total
  return(proportion)
}

majors <- majors |> 
  mutate(proportion_employed = purrr::map2_dbl(Employed_full_time_year_round, Total, calculate_proportion_employed)) |> 
  arrange(desc(proportion_employed))

head(majors)
```

'Management Information Systems and Statistics' and 'Computer and Information Systems' are the majors that have the highest rates of post-graduate employment.

All of our majors are in full capital letters. Let's use `purrr::map_chr()` with `str_to_title()` from the `tidyverse` `stringr` package to change that into proper grammea.

```{r}
majors$Major <- purrr::map_chr(majors$Major, ~str_to_title(.x))

head(majors)
```


We load another .csv file from the same dataset, this time the information on gender breakdown in each major.

```{r}
women_stem <- read_csv('https://github.com/annejscott/DATA607/raw/main/assignments/week9/women-stem.csv', col_names = TRUE, show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  as.data.frame()
```

The `women_stem` dataset has information on gender proportions that doesn't exist in the `majors` dataset. Even though the datasets have different numbers of observations,the  `purrr::map_dbl()` function can map the values from one data set into another.

```{r}
# apply str_to_title to women_stem df so strings in Major column match
women_stem$Major <- purrr::map_chr(women_stem$Major, ~str_to_title(.x))

sharewomen_map <- setNames(women_stem$ShareWomen, women_stem$Major)

majors$ShareWomen <- purrr::map_dbl(majors$Major, ~ sharewomen_map[.x])

head(majors)
```

The `women_stem` dataset has information on gender proportions that doesn't exist in the `majors` dataset. Even though the datasets have different numbers of observations, `purrr::map()` functions can join these datsets together.

women_stem$Major <- purrr::map_chr(women_stem$Major, ~str_to_title(.x))

sharewomen_map <- setNames(women_stem$ShareWomen, women_stem$Major)

# Use map_dbl to match Major values and fill in ShareWomen values in majors df
majors$ShareWomen <- map_dbl(majors$Major, ~ sharewomen_map[.x])

head(majors)
```
